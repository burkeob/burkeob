- 👋    Hi, I’m @burkeob
- 👀    I’m interested in the economics of education, and gaining interesting insights from large datasets. I work primarily in Stata and R, and have a working proficiency with Python. I have used Java and Scala for coursework, but not in any professional capacity. I enjoy creating data visualizataions and writing efficent loops.
- 🌱    I’m currently learning best practices in R and in Stata, particularly relating to modeling. 
- 💞️     I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything really! 
- 📫    How to reach me: burkeob@gmail.com
